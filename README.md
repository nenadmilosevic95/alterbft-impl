# AlterBFT: Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an open-source implementation of AlterBFT, a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol.

> **üìñ Open Source Research Code**
> 
> This implementation is open-sourced to enable **experimentation, learning, and further research**. Feel free to use it, modify it, and build upon it for your own research or educational purposes. We provide an easy Docker-based setup so you can quickly run experiments on your local machine.
>
> **Note**: This is a research prototype. While it demonstrates the core protocol correctly, it is not production-ready. Use it for research, education, and experimentation.

## Overview

AlterBFT is a BFT consensus protocol implementation written in Go. This open-source implementation allows you to experiment with Byzantine consensus, run your own tests, and build upon the protocol.

**What's included:**

- **Agent nodes**: Consensus participants that propose and agree on blocks
- **Rendezvous server**: A discovery service for peer-to-peer connectivity
- **Docker setup**: Run experiments instantly without worrying about dependencies

**Key features:**
- Byzantine fault tolerance with configurable number of Byzantine nodes
- Complete AlterBFT implementation (alter, fast-alter)
- Performance monitoring and comprehensive logging
- Highly configurable for different experimental scenarios
- Easy-to-use Docker setup for quick experimentation

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to try AlterBFT is using Docker. Just run one command and see the consensus protocol in action!

### Prerequisites
- Docker (version 20.10 or later)
- Docker Compose (version 1.29 or later)

### Running the Demo

1. **Clone or extract the repository**:
   ```bash
   cd alterbft-impl
   ```

2. **Run the demonstration**:
   ```bash
   ./run-demo.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the Docker image
   - Start 4 consensus nodes
   - Run 100 epochs of consensus
   - Store results in the `results/` directory

3. **Run with custom number of nodes**:
   ```bash
   ./run-demo.sh 7   # Runs with 7 nodes
   ```

### Understanding the Output

After the demo completes, you'll find the following in the `results/` directory:

- `deliveries.0`, `deliveries.1`, etc.: Delivered blocks for each node (one block per line), each node prints block for height when it was the proposer
- `a.0`, `a.1`, etc.: Detailed execution logs for each node

## Manual Setup (Advanced)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Manual setup requires Go 1.16-1.18. If you have Go 1.19+ installed, **use Docker instead** (recommended above) or downgrade Go to 1.18.

Most systems now have Go 1.19+ by default, which is **incompatible** with this codebase due to dependency constraints. **We strongly recommend using Docker** unless you specifically need to modify the code.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.16 to 1.18 (**NOT 1.19+**)
- Git

### Check Your Go Version
```bash
go version
# If you see go1.19 or higher, use Docker instead!
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd alterbft-impl
   ```

2. **Download dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Compile the binaries**:
   ```bash
   cd bin
   ./xcompile.sh
   ```

   This creates three binaries:
   - `bin/agent/agent`: Consensus node
   - `bin/rendezvous/rendezvous`: Discovery server

### Running Manually

1. **Navigate to the bin directory**:
   ```bash
   cd bin
   ```

2. **Run N nodes**:
   ```bash
   ./test.sh 4   # Runs 4 consensus nodes
   ```

3. **View results**:
   ```bash
   cat logs/deliveries.0   # View blocks delivered by node 0
   wc -l logs/deliveries.*  # Count blocks delivered by each node
   ```

## Running Experiments

All experiments can be run using `./run-demo.sh` with Docker (recommended).

### Basic Experiments

**1. Different system sizes**:
```bash
./run-demo.sh 4    # 4 nodes (f=1)
./run-demo.sh 7    # 7 nodes (f=2)
./run-demo.sh 10   # 10 nodes (f=3)
```

**2. Byzantine nodes**:
```bash
./run-demo.sh 4 -byz 1 -attack silence   # 1 Byzantine node with silence attack
./run-demo.sh 7 -byz 2 -attack equiv     # 2 Byzantine nodes with equivocation attack
```

**3. Optimizations**:
```bash
./run-demo.sh 4 -mod alter              # Standard AlterBFT
./run-demo.sh 4 -mod alter -fast true   # FastAlter optimization
```

**4. Custom timeouts**:
```bash
./run-demo.sh 4 -s-delta 200 -b-delta 1500   # Small delta: 200ms, Big delta: 1500ms
```

### Advanced Configuration

The agent binary supports many configuration options:

```bash
cd bin/agent
./agent -h   # Show all available options
```

Key parameters:
- `-n <N>`: Total number of nodes
- `-i <ID>`: Node ID (0 to N-1)
- `-byz <F>`: Number of Byzantine nodes
- `-attack <TYPE>`: Byzantine behavior (silence, equiv)
- `-s-delta <MS>`: Small delta timeout (milliseconds)
- `-b-delta <MS>`: Big delta timeout (milliseconds)
- `-maxEpoch <N>`: Number of consensus epochs to run
- `-mod <MODEL>`: Consensus model (alter, fast-alter)
- `-fast`: Enable FastAlter optimization
- `-topology <TYPE>`: Network topology (full, gossip, star)

## Output and Results

### Delivery Files

Each node produces a `deliveries.<node-id>` file containing one delivered block per line. Format:
```
<epoch>:<block-hash>:<block-value-hash>:<timestamp>
```

### Log Files

Each node produces a log file `a.<node-id>` with detailed execution information including:
- Peer discovery and connection
- Consensus rounds and phases
- Message send/receive events
- Performance statistics

## Configuration Options

### Consensus Models

- **alter**: Standard AlterBFT protocol
- **fast-alter**: With FastAlter optimization

### Byzantine Attacks

- **silence**: Byzantine leaders remain silent
- **equiv**: Byzantine leaders send equivocating proposals 


## Use Cases and Limitations

**What you can do with this code:**
- üî¨ **Experiment** with Byzantine consensus protocols
- üìö **Learn** how BFT consensus works in practice
- üîß **Build** your own consensus protocol variations
- üìä **Benchmark** different configurations and parameters
- üéì **Teach** distributed systems and consensus concepts

**Important limitations:**
- This is a **research prototype**, not production-ready software
- Intended for **controlled experimental environments**

If you're building a production system, treat this as a reference implementation and starting point, but plan for significant additional engineering, security auditing, and testing.
